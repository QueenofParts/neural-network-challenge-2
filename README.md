Module 19 Challenge
Module 19 Challenge - Marnie Brannon
This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts covered in Modules up to and including module 19 of AI Bootcamp.
Motivation: My motivation in working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several data coding concepts and practices. The exercise needed to use the following ML concepts discussed in class: prepare, test and train data, scaling features, using StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder.  Then I create, compile and train our model, by creating layers,and a branch to predict attrition followed by additional hidden layers and an output layer. I then created, compiled and summarized the model and trained and tested the data.
I worked on this alone (I‚Äôm trying to do more on my own) getting all of my answers from our slides, in class examples, and AI sites such as chat GPT or BCS  Learning Assistant. I am very proud of myself for getting through more and more exercises without getting "stuck" and having to use office hours, tutoring or other students to help me get past my obstacle. Alexander Vargas in particular has been reminding me to use resources to find my own answers and be my own tutor.
The focus of this exercise: This project asks two simple questions: Can a neural network be used to accurately predict whether employees are at risk of leaving the company and could employees be better suited for other departments.  The problem it solves is: Improving the issues with employee morale and satisfaction.
What did you learn? In completing this exercise, I learned the following:
‚Ä¢ that I am getting more confident in my coding
‚Ä¢ that linear regression and random forest classification models are easy to use
‚Ä¢ that you can accurately predict the results you are looking for if you use the right model, provided you have good quality data
What did you struggle with? I struggled with importing functions at first, but Omar helped me by recognizing a naming error that prevented my code from working. Once that was cleared up, i was able to continue fairly well. I also had a problem with the program getting stuck on line 27 where I accidentally left off a comma. I did eventually find that by Chat GPT after much frustration. Tutor Lebuso Philly helped me correct the format of the return and streamline a few clunky bits of code I'd made.

Websites and other Sources: ###Websites:
During the work on this this assignment, my colaborators and I used the following websites for reminders of the syntax and structure of certain commands and clarificatrion regarding the specifics of their use:
‚Ä¢ Chat GPT -- www.chatgpt.com
‚Ä¢ GeeksforGeeks -- www.geeksforgeeks.com
‚Ä¢ Python Principles -- www.pythonprinciples.com
‚Ä¢ Stack Overflow -- www.stackoverflow.com
‚Ä¢ Simplilearn.com -- www.simplilearn.com
Books: I also referred to the following books for reminders, symtax rules and guidence regarding Python commands:
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe Python Workshop, 2nd ed‚Äù (Packt, 2022) Bird, Han, Jiminez, Lee and Wade
‚Ä¢ "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition" (no starch press, 2019) Mathes
Applications and Extensions: ‚Ä¢ GitBash
‚Ä¢ VSCode
‚Ä¢ Copilot
‚Ä¢ Black Formatter
‚Ä¢ Pandas
‚Ä¢ SKLearn
‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebooks
Video Tutorials: License: The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to https://choosealicense.com/.
üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections. Badges
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. Features If your project has a lot of features, list them here. How to Contribute If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. Tests Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. provides predictive results using inputted interest rates
